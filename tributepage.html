                <h2>'Anathanchi Yashoda'</h2>
                <p><b>Sindhutai Sapkal</b> (14 November 1948 â€“ 4 January 2022) (pronunciation) was an Indian social
                    worker and social activist known particularly for her work in raising orphaned children in India.
                    She was awarded the Padma Shri in 2021 in Social Work category.Sapkal was born on 14 November
                    1948,[1] in Pimpri Meghe village in Wardha district in the then Central Provinces and Berar of
                    Dominion of India to Abhimanyu Sathe, a cowherder.[2][3] Being an unwanted child, she was referred
                    to as Chindhi (Marathi for "piece of rag").Abject poverty, family responsibilities and an early
                    marriage forced her to quit formal education after she successfully passed the fourth standard.[4]
                    Sapkal was married off at age 12 to Shrihari Sapkal, who was 20 years older than her, and moved to
                    Nawargaon village, Seloo in Wardha.[5] The marriage did not last long and at the age of 20,[5] she
                    was left on her own to care for a girl child.[6][3][7]</p>
